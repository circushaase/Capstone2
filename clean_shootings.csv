Additional entities to include the Crisis Negotiations Team and K9 were called to the scene to assist. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to establish contact with the man inside the residence. An Emergency Custody Order was issued by a magistrate, which obligated the Police Department to take physical custody of the individual and transport him to a facility where he could receive mental health treatment. A dialogue was established between the man and a uniformed SWAT officer positioned outside a basement window. The SWAT officer identified himself as an officer and attempted to persuade the man to surrender by exiting the front door. As the SWAT officer continued to negotiate with the man, other uniformed SWAT officers and a K9 officer positioned themselves inside the home but outside of the manâ€™s bedroom. The subject suddenly charged from his location and fired a weapon multiple times at officers. A SWAT officer, who was positioned inside the home, immediately discharged his service weapon striking the subject. A SWAT medical officer and the Operations Medical Director immediately provided aid until relieved by Fire and Rescue personnel. The man was transported to Inova Fairfax Hospital where he was treated for his injuries. The manâ€™s weapon, a BB gun that is powered by a COâ‚‚ cartridge, was recovered at the scene.",FairfaxCounty,TX
