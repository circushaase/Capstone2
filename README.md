# Capstone2
Second Capstone project for Springboard's Data Science bootcamp. Using data on deaths in police custody in Texas as well as Officer Related Shootings. 

Unsupervised Machine Learning/Clustering was used to look for un-obvious relationships in the data. Several algorithms were tested, but Kmeans Clustering proved to be the most reliable for both datasets.

Data were grouped into clusters, then clusters were visualized for each feature.
